# Dreamnotes

## Introduction. How I got that idea? 

This is my first attempt to a ReactApp and itÂ´s focused on a diary where to write what you dream.
Dreams are a way in which your subconscious communicates with you, and that information can be very relevant.
 For a few years I kept a dream diary, I tried it in several ways and it was best to write it down immediately upon waking because after some details fade, I realized that it was much more practical to write them down a mobile device since you have it easily at hand in your bed and you don't have to look for a pen, open a notebook, you can even write it while still lying down, that's why this app is designed for mobile devices and its development is Mobile first.
 It is important to avoid distractors in the period of waking from sleep and write it to concentrate on the dream and thus not lose the details, since dreams evoke images, sounds, aromas and sensations. Therefore I did not add images to the design and try to keep it simple but at the same time tidy.
I didn't love the login at first because of the need not to get distracted by having access to the app although it can be a security measure since it is something private where we do not necessarily want other people to have access.
In a future iteration I would like to be able to select the notes by color, where there is a different color for each day of the week, since dreams are not remembered every day and there may be specific days when we remember them more frequently and a greater number. Also I would like to implement an automatical save of the date the note is written.

 This was the low fidelity prototype in which I added the general ideas to a notes app.
